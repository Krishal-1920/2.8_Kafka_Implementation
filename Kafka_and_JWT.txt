*) Kafka
- Open Source distributed event streaming platform 

- Kafka is designed to handle data that is constantly being generated and needs to be processed as it comes in, without delays

*) What are it's use 

=> Real-time Data Processing: Handles data streams in real-time (e.g., logs, user activities, stock prices).
=> Scalability: Can handle millions of messages per second across multiple servers.
=> Decoupling Services: Allows different systems (like microservices) to communicate without direct dependencies.
=> Fault Tolerance: Stores data in a distributed and replicated way to prevent data loss.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************
*) Kafka Cluster

A Kafka Cluster is a group of Kafka brokers (servers) working together to handle large-scale, real-time data streams. It ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability.

Key Components of a Kafka Cluster

=> Brokers → Servers that store and manage messages. A cluster has multiple brokers.
=> Topics & Partitions → Data is split into topics and further into partitions for parallel processing.
=> Producers → Send messages to the cluster.
=> Consumers → Read messages from the cluster.
=> Zookeeper → Manages brokers, leader election, and metadata.


Kafka Producer --> Kafka Cluster --> Kafka Consumer

- Zookeeper monitors the health of of Kafka Cluster

-> kafka connect is connected to kafka cluster (which is use to bring something from external source)

-> Kafka stream is also connected to kafka cluster (which is used for tranmission of data inside or outside of the kafka cluster).

=> What is a Kafka Topic?

-> A topic is like a category or folder where messages are stored.
	Example:
	Imagine a WhatsApp group where people send messages. The group name is the topic, and all messages sent in the group belong to that topic.

=> What is a Kafka Partition?

-> A partition is like a separate notebook inside a topic.
	Kafka splits a topic into multiple partitions to make it faster and more scalable.
	Messages inside a partition are ordered, but across partitions, they are not.
	when we send data , Data passed inside the partition in the Round Robin fashion.

- Also there is partitioner which is responsible for watching the data if data has Key then it will send accordingly and thus it can be possible that in a single partition the data get into sequence instead of RoundRobin.
- If Data has key then it will go in the partition otherwise it will go in a round robin fashion.
- For ordering make sure the data should go with key

	Example:
	Imagine a bookstore where a best-selling book is split into multiple sections (partitions) to be printed at the same time by different printers. This speeds up 	the process.

=> What is a Kafka Offset?

-> An offset is like a page number in a notebook (partition).
	Each message in a partition gets a unique number (offset) so Kafka knows where it is stored.
	Consumers use offsets to remember where they last read.
	Example:
	If you're reading a book (partition), you use a bookmark (offset) to remember the last page you read.

*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************
*) ### Kafka Consumer Offsets & Group Coordination (Simplified)  

In Kafka, consumers read messages from topics and use offsets (bookmarks) to remember where they left off.  

### Consumer Offsets  
- Each consumer tracks its offset for every partition it reads.  
- Kafka stores offsets automatically, but consumers can also save them manually.  
- If a consumer restarts, it resumes from the last saved offset instead of starting over.  

### How Consumers Join & Get Partitions  
1. A consumer joins a group and requests partitions.  
2. The Group Coordinator assigns partitions based on available consumers.  
3. The consumer starts reading messages from its assigned partitions.  
4. Consumers try to keep the same partitions (sticky assignment) to continue smoothly after a rebalance.  

### Segments & Commit Log  
- Segment: Kafka stores messages in segments, which are chunks of data inside partitions.  
- Commit Log: Kafka logs all messages in order, like a history of everything published. Offsets help consumers read from the right place in this log.  

Kafka’s system ensures efficient, reliable, and scalable message processing 🚀.
